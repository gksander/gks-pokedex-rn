# React Native Pokedex

This project started as a place to experiment with animations and design in React Native. This sample app consists of
 a landing screen (a list of Pokemon), and a screen for viewing the details of a selected Pokemon.

## Technology Used

Under the hood, this sample app uses:

- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) and [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) (for fetching the Pokemon data)
- [React Native Fast Image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image) (for efficiently rendering the images)
- [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg) (for creating the Stats graphics)
- [PokeAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi) for the Pokemon data.
- [PokemonSVG](https://github.com/jnovack/pokemon-svg) for the Pokemon images.

The data was processed in a web-app project [found here](https://github.com/gksander/gks-pokedex-gridsome). This RN
 app just pulls data from the JSON files generated by that project.

## Running the App

To run the project, clone this app and go through the React Native installation process (the RN app is in the
 directory `GksPokedexRN`). This should get you most of the way:
 
 ```sh
cd GksPokedexRN
yarn # to install node deps
cd ios && pod install # to install CocoaPod deps
```

Then to run the app, run `yarn start` and `yarn ios` from inside `GksPokedexRN`.
